# TensorFlowRequirements
This repo act as a guidance on which Nvidia drivers should be installed according to TensorFlow version. Such as TF v1.13 for CUDA version 10.0 and above.

The reason this repo existed because of how people always getting confused which nVidia drivers should they install to make it parallel with TensorFlow requirements.

As of now my machine can't even install nVidia drivers version 438 due to the compatibility issue, could be with my current hardware. As of nVidia Experience software also indicates that v376.54 is that latest drivers available and installed.
